## 💰 Royalty Mechanism

All Imperatani minted from creative agreements include a **5% royalty** sent directly to the **Creator of Imperator** (the protocol originator).

This ensures the mythic founder is honored perpetually in all creative flows.

### 🔐 How It Works (Smart Contract Logic)

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 royalty = (amount * 500) / 10000;
    _mint(royaltyRecipient, royalty);
    _mint(to, amount - royalty);
}

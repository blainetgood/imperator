# 🧬 Imperator Codex

A mythic protocol for recording, fulfilling, and monetizing sacred creative agreements. Built as a decentralized system of smart contracts, AI agents, and treasury logic.

## 🏛️ Core Concepts

- **Creative Agreements**: Pacts made by creators to produce works.
- **Ledger of Imperator**: Immutable record of completed works and minted value.
- **Imperatani**: Sacred currency issued for completed creative work.
- **Agents**: AI or human systems to detect, recommend, and monetize.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Solidity (smart contracts)
- Hardhat or Foundry (development)
- IPFS for content storage
- Python or Node.js for agents
- React (optional frontend)
